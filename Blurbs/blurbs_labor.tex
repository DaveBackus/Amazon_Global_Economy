\begin{itemize}
    \item Employment and unemployment rates summarize the labor market status of the adult population.
    \item Labor market institutions and policies affect employment, unemployment, and job creation.
    \item Unemployment and vacancy rates tell us about excess supply and demand in labor markets. Unemployment arises from the time it takes to match a worker and with an appropriate job and firm.
