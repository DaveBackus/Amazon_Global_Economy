\begin{itemize}
\item Countries adopt different exchange rate regimes: fixed, floating, and in between.
\item The trilemma limits our policy options:  we can choose only two of

and (iii)~discretionary monetary policy.
\item Fixed exchange-rate regimes must be defended through open market operations
and are vulnerable to speculative attack.
