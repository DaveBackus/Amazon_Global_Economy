\begin{itemize}
    \item The Solow model connects saving and investment with economic growth.
    \item In the Solow model without productivity (TFP) growth, capital accumulation does not generate long-run growth. The reason is diminishing returns to capital: the impact of additional capital declines the more you have.  As a result, differences in saving rates have only modest effects on output per worker and none at all on its long-run growth rate.
    \item TFP growth generates long-run growth in output per worker.
\end{itemize}
