\begin{itemize}
    \item GDP is three things at once:  production (value added by production units), income (payments to labor and capital), and expenditure (consumption, investment, government spending, net exports).

    \item Current price variables (such as nominal GDP) can be decomposed into measures of price and quantity. There are several ways to do this, but none of them are perfect.
\end{itemize}

%%The two methods to decompose current price variables into changes in prices and quantities are fixed price and %fixed basket price indexes. These two methods are useful, but not without problems.
