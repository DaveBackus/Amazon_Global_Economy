\begin{itemize}
    \item The objectives of monetary policy are generally thought to be (i)~stable prices and (ii)~output near its long-run equilibrium level.
\item A direct consequence is that monetary policy should respond differently to demand and supply shocks.
As a general rule, policy should resist/offset changes in output triggered by shifts in demand
and accommodate/reinforce changes triggered by shifts in supply.
    \item We can identify supply or demand shocks from whether output and prices move together or in opposite directions.
