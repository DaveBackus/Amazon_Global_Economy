\begin{itemize}
    \item Inflation is the growth rate of the price level, which is typically measured by a price index.
    \item The quantity theory links the money supply with the price level and output. In the long run, an increase in the money supply results in an increase in the price level (inflation).
    \item Hyperinflation refers to an inflation rate of 100\% per year or more. 
    Hyperinflations follow a standard pattern: government deficits are financed with money, which produces inflation.
        We call this {\it fiscal dominance\/} over monetary policy. 
\end{itemize}
