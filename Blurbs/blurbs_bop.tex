\begin{itemize}
\item A current account deficit implies that a country is borrowing from the rest of the
world; we refer to this as a capital inflow.
A current account surplus --- a capital outflow --- implies that a country is lending to the
rest of the world.
\item
A capital inflow (borrowing) can lead to problems if
it does not support productive activities.
For this reason, analysts often focus on the reasons for capital flows as well as their magnitude.

\item The dynamics of net foreign assets are analogous to government debt dynamics.
\end{itemize}
