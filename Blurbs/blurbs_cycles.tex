\begin{itemize}
    \item Economies do not grow smoothly or regularly. We refer to the fluctuations in economic activity as business cycles.
    \item Growth rates of expenditure components move up and down with GDP over the business cycle, but they move by different amounts. Spending on investment and consumer durables moves more than output; we say it is more volatile. Spending on services and nondurable goods is less volatile than output. Labor and capital markets move with the cycle as well.
\end{itemize}
