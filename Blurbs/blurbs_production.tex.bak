\begin{itemize}
    \item A production function relates output (real GDP) to inputs (capital and labor). Ours have three essential properties: (i) more inputs lead to more output; (ii) diminishing returns to capital and labor; (iii) constant returns to scale.
    \item The Cobb-Douglas production function is a specific form that we'll use throughout.
    \item Total factor productivity (TFP) is the overall efficiency with which inputs are transformed into outputs.
\end{itemize}
