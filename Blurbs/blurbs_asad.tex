\begin{itemize}
    \item The AS/AD model relates output and prices in the short and long runs. The model is composed of (i) an upward-sloping short-run aggregate supply curve, which inherits its shape from sticky wages; (ii) a vertical long-run aggregate supply curve; and (iii) a downward-sloping aggregate demand curve.
    \item Shocks to the aggregate supply and demand curves have different effects on inflation and output.
\end{itemize}
