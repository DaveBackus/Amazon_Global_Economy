\begin{itemize}
    \item Level and growth accounting allow us to \emph{quantify} the sources of growth: the contributions of capital, labor, and total factor productivity (TFP) to growth in real GDP.
    \item TFP accounts for most of the cross-country differences in output per worker and in differences in the growth rate of output per worker.
\end{itemize}
