%\textbf{Measurement}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item GDP is value added, payments to labor and capital, and expenditure. These three measurement are linked through accounting identities.
%\item Current price variables (like nominal GDP) can be decomposed into price changes and quantity (real) changes. The two methods to decompose current price variables into changes in prices and quantities are fixed price and fixed basket price indexes.
%\item GDP tells us a lot about an economy; price indexes are useful, but not without problems
%\end{itemize}
