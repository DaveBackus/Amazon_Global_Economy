%To create a single chapter with the correct page numbering and references:                        %
%This isn't elegant, if you know a better way to do this, tell me.                                 %
%                                                                                                  %
% 1.  Go into preamble and set bookmarks=false.                                                    %
% 2.  Compile the entire book                                                                      %
% 3.  Uncomment the appropriate "includeonly" statement.                                           %
% 4.  The pdf will still be called "The_Global_Economy," so save it with the right filename.       %
% 5.  Some chapters may have a blank page at the beginning.  Use Acrobat to delete it.             %
