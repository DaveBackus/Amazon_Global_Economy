This document evolved from a set of notes developed
for the Global Economy course at New York
University's Stern School of Business.
The idea behind the course is to use the tools of macroeconomics
to assess the economic performance of countries
and the challenges facing businesses operating in them.
We emphasize data;
virtually every chapter includes links to useful data sources.
The book is designed as background reading.
It focuses on tools,
leaving us to spend most of our class time on applications.

We have put all of our materials online
and offer them to others with similar interests in the hope
that they will reciprocate.
``We'' here means the Global Economy team:
Dave Backus, Gian Luca Clementi, Tom Cooley, Joe Foudy, Kim Ruhl, Kim Schoenholtz,
Laura Veldkamp, Venky Venkateswaran, Paul Wachtel, Mike Waugh, and Stan Zin.
This set of notes is available online
through the
\href{http://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/about/departments-centers-initiatives/centers-of-research/global-economy-business/index.htm}
{Center for Global Economy and Business}
at

The same site includes the Stata files used to generate figures.
The online version of the notes includes color graphs
and an extensive collection of links.
We also offer an inexpensive black-and-white printed version through Amazon,
``self-published'' through their CreateSpace facility,
which we were delighted with.
%(search ``amazon self-publish'').

Additional materials are available to those who ask nicely.
That includes slides (we're at the front end of a Powerpoint to Beamer conversion),
problem sets, exams, and R code for a variety of data sources.
We're equally interested in your thoughts:  on the course,
the materials, teaching macroeconomics, or anything else that crosses
your mind.
Send us an email, we're easy to track down.

One last request:  Please pass on any typos or other glitches you find.
Your efforts will help us improve future versions.
